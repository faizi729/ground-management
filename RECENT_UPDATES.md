# Recent System Updates - August 2025

## Receipt Generation System Enhancement

### Problem Solved
The receipt preview and PDF generation was showing incorrect payment data, combining information from multiple bookings rather than displaying booking-specific details. Additionally, there was no way for users to access receipts from previous payments.

### Solution Implemented

#### 1. Fixed Receipt Data Generation
**File Modified:** `server/routes.ts` - `generateReceiptData()` function
- **Enhanced Data Collection**: Now retrieves all payments for a specific booking to calculate accurate payment history
- **Booking-Specific Calculations**: Calculates total paid before current payment for accurate balance display
- **Proper Time Slot Display**: Fetches booking slots for accurate time range display
- **Comprehensive Financial Data**: Includes detailed breakdown with discounts, previous payments, and balances

#### 2. Enhanced Receipt Display
**File Modified:** `server/receipt.ts` - HTML and PDF templates
- **Detailed Payment Breakdown**: Shows complete financial transparency
  - Total Booking Amount (including discounts)
  - Discount Applied (highlighted in green)
  - Amount After Discount
  - Total Paid (Before This Payment)
  - Due Amount (Before This Payment)
  - Amount Paid This Transaction (current payment)
  - Remaining Balance
- **Professional Formatting**: Color-coded sections for better readability
- **Comprehensive Details**: All booking and payment information in one receipt

#### 3. Payment History Feature
**New File:** `client/src/components/PaymentHistoryModal.tsx`
- **Complete Payment Tracking**: Modal interface showing all payments for a booking
- **Booking Summary**: Displays total amounts, discounts, paid amounts, and remaining balance
- **Individual Payment Records**: Each payment listed with amount, date, method, and status
- **Receipt Access**: Preview and download options for every payment receipt
- **Real-time Balance Calculations**: Accurate financial summaries

**API Enhancement:** New endpoint `/api/bookings/:bookingId/payment-history`
- **Secure Access**: Users can only view their own booking payment history (admins can view all)
- **Comprehensive Data**: Returns booking details and all associated payments
- **Optimized Queries**: Efficient database queries for payment history retrieval

#### 4. User Interface Integration
**File Modified:** `client/src/pages/Payment.tsx`
- **Payment History Button**: Added to payment page header for easy access
- **Seamless Integration**: Consistent with existing UI patterns and styling
- **Responsive Design**: Works properly on all device sizes

### Technical Implementation Details

#### Backend Changes
1. **Enhanced Data Retrieval**
   ```typescript
   // Get all payments for booking to calculate totals
   const allPayments = await storage.getPayments(booking.id);
   const sortedPayments = allPayments.sort(...);
   const totalPaidBeforeThis = sortedPayments.slice(0, currentPaymentIndex)...
   ```

2. **Booking Slot Integration**
   ```typescript
   // Get booking slots for accurate time display
   const bookingSlots = await storage.getBookingSlots(booking.id);
   const firstSlot = bookingSlots[0];
   ```

3. **Security & Authorization**
   ```typescript
   // Verify user access to booking payment history
   if (booking.userId !== req.user.id && req.user.role !== 'admin') {
     return res.status(403).json({ message: "Access denied" });
   }
   ```

#### Frontend Changes
1. **Payment History Modal**
   - Responsive dialog interface with comprehensive payment display
   - Real-time data fetching with loading states
   - Error handling for failed requests
   - Integration with existing receipt system

2. **Receipt Enhancement**
   - Updated receipt data structure to include all new financial fields
